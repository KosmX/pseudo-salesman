# Pseudo-salesman  
**Featuring: recursive spaghetti in Kotlin**

---

This is a pseudo solver for [Travelling Salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)  
Designed to optimize path for [simonyiszk/scopelogo](https://github.com/simonyiszk/scopelogo)

---

An [ESP](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) unit is jumping between pre-programmed keypoints and a [Low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) is smoothing the dost to lines  
But without optimization, there is too much jumping between characters.  

This project is to minimize that jumping
